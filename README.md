Element 2: Practical exam 

 

The practical assessment of this unit includes the following two components:  
 

Part A: This part includes producing a creative piece of work using the p5.js framework. The piece of work you submit is expected to be well-documented (commented) and structured code. 

Part B: This part builds upon the project produced in Part A and involves submitting a 600-800 word writeup that contextually frames and grounds your project. 

Note: Even though this element consists of two parts, they’re not separate but in-fact part of the same project and work in tandem. You may want to work on them together as it might help develop a more well-thought-out and grounded project.  

Please also submit a screen recording of your project working in case your code breaks or does not work for some reason. This way we have something to still mark you on. Place this within the Git Repo of your project.

Your project should also accompany a readme file with a set of instructions on how to run it, for example if it needs to be run through a live server, please state that. 

 
Submitting your work 


For Part A, save your code into a GIT repository that you create on git.arts.ac.uk. And for part B, save your text to a PDF and upload it to the same GIT repository as part A. You must then share the link to your git.arts.ac.uk repository via Moodle’s submission system. You may wish to make your repository private and add us as collaborators so that only we may see your work.Please use the following username below on git.arts.ac.uk and add all three of them as collaborators to your private repo so that we may mark your work.

Brief 

 

Part A 

You are expected to produce a creative piece of work using the p5.js framework within a given set of constraints specified below. Beyond these constraints, you are free to include any other p5.js or JavaScript techniques, functions, or libraries to realize your creative vision. The scope of what you can produce creatively has been left open for you to work on something that you are interested in, and something that is achievable in the time that the assessment allows. 

 

Technical constraints  


Any two of the following must be incorporated into your project:   

    An array. 

    A nested ‘While’ or ‘For’ Loop.  

    A conditional statement (<, >, ==, >=, <=).  

    A custom function (i.e. one you have written).  

    Use of p5.js’ map().  

    Utilize an API to obtain and use at least one data point in your work. 

    Incorporate a GUI element (i.e. button or a slider)  

    Make use of an event (i.e. keyboard, mouse - see p5js.org/reference). 

 

Part B 

Write a short statement situating your p5.js project (part A) in a broader social, economic, and technical context. We are looking for between 600-800 words, and encourage you to draw from the lectures, practical exercises, and inspirational work you have encountered in this unit (and across the diploma), alongside your everyday experiences of computing and network use.  

To help you write, consider there is no story too small or insignificant as computation can be understood through multiple scales and registers. Those scales can range from the personal act of writing a ‘for loop’ to the scale of call centers, social media platforms, global migration, or a university education system. Registers to consider might include commentary on technical, aesthetic, economic, race, class, gender, institutional, ethical, or emotional associations of your project – meaning the act of writing and running code can be thought about in more than technical terms.   

In your text, we expect you to highlight examples of work that have inspired you, and the ways you have built-on, or leveraged, those ideas in your submitted project. Finally, we expect you to reflect on what has worked, what didn’t, what could be improved, and how your project could be extended. 

 

Rough Structure Suggestion (Not set in stone): 

Introduction (~ 250 Words) - Introducing what the project is about. Framing and contextualizing the idea. 

Inspiration/Examples (150 Words) - Other pieces of work that have inspired you and how have you drawn upon that inspiration and how it connect your work. These could include any text/literature or art/design projects. 

Process (~ 200 Words) - The iterative process you followed. How you have taken certain decisions and arrived at the final outcome from your starting point. This might also entail linking your decisions with the project’s initial aim and why that was the best choice to achieve the desired outcome. 

Reflections ( ~ 200 Words) - Based on your initial idea and what you set out to do. What worked? What didn’t work? And What would you improve? Reflect critically on your work and process.
